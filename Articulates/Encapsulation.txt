Now that you have learned about the principle of encapsulation, and designed and developed a program using it, 
return to I-Learn and answer the following question (the way you would in a job interview):

// Question to answer.
What is encapsulation and why is it important?

// Answer development.
Our age is surrounded by technology, which has enable the mankind to create services taht were never imagined before,
some examples are: making purchases online, participating in clinical research remotely, handling our bank transactions
in the website on the internet. 

With this comes the security and data input from our end and the law requires the programs, apps, websites to have a proper 
usage of the customers information that can be sensitive. By making our program with the encapsulation, programmers can 
fulfill this proper data handeling, by writing the code in a way that is hermetic within the same class that was included
prohibing the access for another class or function and making those to ask for permission.

By writing an encasulated code, programs will be even more flexible allowing to be editted in an easier way.
This works to avoid the date to be shown in another part that in the program that it should supposed to be showing.
Please look at the following example:
    using System;

    public class fraction
    {
        private int _top = 0;
        private int _bottom = 0;

        public fraction() 
        {
            _top = 1;
            _bottom = 1;
        }

        public fraction(int wholeNumber)
        {
            _top = wholeNumber;
            _bottom = 1;
        }

        public fraction(int top, int bottom)
        {
            _top = top;
            _bottom = bottom;
        }

        public string GetFractionString() 
        {
            string fraction = $"{_top}/{_bottom}";
            return fraction;
        }

        public double GetDecimalValue()
        {
            return (double)_top / (double)_bottom;
        }
    }
