//Intructions:
Now that you have learned about the principle of abstraction, 
and designed and developed a program using it, return to I-Learn 
and answer the following question (the way you would in a job interview)

// Question to answer.
What is abstraction and why is it important?

// Answer development.
Abstractions is something humans have been doing to make thing simpler for the user and learners. 
Consists in hiding complex ideas and processes to make it more readable and understandable
to someone is not related to the specific field of that idea or process and enables them to use it
in their daily basis. making this a benefit to a better life quality to mankind.

Abstraction in a way can be compare as a movie or TV show. The work that is made behind the scene
like the scripts, makeup, cameras, lights, scenography, video edition, actors trying to personified
their characters and bringing them to live is not watch by the viewer. The Job of the viewer is not 
related to understable the behind the scenes but just to understand the movie and plot and enjoy it.

In programming we do the same as by following the requirements to program with classes which enables 
the programmer to filter what is really important to the user. For example the folliwing code is what 
a user needs to fulfill for their resume:
        Job job1 = new Job();
        job1._jobTitle = "Software Engineer";
        job1._company = "Microsoft";
        job1._startYear = "2019";
        job1._endYear = "2022";

But what really compiles all that information and show it back to them with a specific format is the following code:
    public class Job 
    {
        public string _jobTitle = "";
        public string _company = "";
        public string _startYear = "";
        public string _endYear = "";

        public Job ()
        {
        }

        public void Display()
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"{_jobTitle} ({_company}) {_startYear}-{_endYear}");
        }
    }
