Intructions 
Now that you have learned about the principle of version control and practiced using Git and GitHub, 
answer the following question (the way you would in a job interview):


// Question to answer.
What is version control and why is it important?


// Answer development.
A version control is how developers can work across teams or with their team while creating a program. 
This allows developers to know the changes that are made in the program and who made them. 

An important part of the version control is that makes the team to have a history of their work and 
gives the required visibility to all, to better know how to help across, making this a great benefit for 
the program users or requestors, becuase based on the feedback a feature that maybe was deleted can be 
restore with the previous versions and all will know in what version was that feature in, doing things more agile
that makes an impact to the business's productivity in a good way, and when productivity is rised the company or project
is more beneficiated by it.

For version control the most used one is Git that gives the several options to update the project's repository which
is the compilated of folders and files that are worked across the team to organized the different codes and program features.
Git has the GUI (Graphical User Interface) and the CMD or Bash options that are based on a command line prompter.
Those last too are use with commands for example the "git clone" that takes from the web based repository with all 
the folders and files organization on GitHub and makes an on-premises copy.
